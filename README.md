# Sonic on SAS

# TL;DR;

Run the following two lines of code in SAS 9, and open the link in the log, to stream a html page with an embedded Sonic The Hedgehog game!

```
filename playme url "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allanbowe/sonic/master/sonic.sas";
%inc playme;
```

# What?  Why?

This project is just a bit of fun and a minimalist demonstration of using the [SASjs](https://sasjs.io) framework to stream web apps from SAS.

# How?

You can run the `sonic.sas` file directly in SAS to create the Web Services, or you can use the `sasjs-cli` tool to [auto deploy](https://cli.sasjs.io/deploy)).   Just run the following commands:

```shell
npm install
sasjs auth
sasjs cbd -t [yourtarget]
```

Please note that the streamed game is actually sourced in an iframe from a third party provider (https://funhtml5games.com/?embed=sonic), and may not work if you have a restricted content-security-policy.
